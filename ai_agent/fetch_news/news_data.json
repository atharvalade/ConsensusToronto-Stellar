    "summary": "The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged in May, following a 0.3% rise in April. This zero monthly change was the softest reading since July 2022 and below economists' expectations. Annually, CPI rose 3.3%, down from 3.4% in April and the lowest rate since April 2021. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy, increased by a modest 0.2% month-over-month and 3.4% year-over-year, also marking a three-year low. The data suggests inflation is gradually moving back towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nThe report provided a significant positive surprise regarding inflation, initially boosting market sentiment and expectations for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later in the year. Lower inflation eases the pressure on consumers' purchasing power and provides the Fed with more flexibility in monetary policy. However, this positive inflation news was later tempered by the Federal Reserve's own projections released the same day, which indicated fewer rate cuts than the market had previously priced in.",

The projection for 2025 was slightly more aggressive, with a median of four cuts, but the immediate shift to fewer cuts this year disappointed some market participants who had hoped for more aggressive easing following the CPI report.

    "summary": "Elections for the European Parliament held across the European Union saw a significant surge for far-right and conservative parties in several key member states. While the center-right and center-left blocs are expected to retain their majority collectively, the strong performance of nationalist and Eurosceptic parties in countries like France, Germany, Austria, and Italy signals a shift in the political mood across the continent and could influence EU policy direction on issues like immigration, climate change, and economic integration.\n\nIn response to the strong showing of the far-right National Rally party, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the French National Assembly and called for snap legislative elections. This unexpected move has created significant political uncertainty in France, the EU's second-largest economy. The outcome of these national elections will be closely watched as they could impact France's role within the EU and its ability to push through domestic reforms, potentially affecting European markets and the stability of the Eurozone.",
