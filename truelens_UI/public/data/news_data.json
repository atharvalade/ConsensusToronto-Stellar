    "summary": "The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025, marking its fastest quarterly growth rate in a year and positioning it as the top performer among G7 nations. Growth was driven by the services and production sectors, with exports—particularly to the US—rising significantly ahead of Donald Trump’s new tariff regime.\n\nDespite the positive data, economists caution that the growth surge may not last due to impending economic headwinds and global trade tensions. While the Labour government celebrated the results as validation of its economic policies, rising mortgage repossessions and defaults on utility payments indicate continued financial stress for households.",

The escalation followed a brief truce during which Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander was released. Israel stated it was targeting militants after Hamas rocket attacks, urging civilians to evacuate.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in severe humanitarian consequences, with the World Health Organization warning of famine conditions amid a three-month blockade. The U.S. and Israel have agreed to deliver aid, but logistical challenges persist. President Trump suggested turning Gaza into a 'freedom zone' under American oversight, raising speculation about U.S. territorial involvement.

Additional strikes in northern Gaza, particularly Jabaliya, killed 13 more. This marks the second night of intense bombing amid ongoing conflict. Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seeks to escalate its military operation to eliminate Hamas, which governs Gaza. The war began when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023. Israel's retaliation has resulted in over 53,000 Palestinian deaths and nearly 120,000 injuries, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nGaza's European Hospital in Khan Younis, the last facility providing cancer treatment, was rendered non-operational by Israeli strikes, forcing the evacuation of 200 patients. Additionally, Israel’s blockade, now in its third month, has halted all aid, pushing nearly half a million Palestinians to the brink of starvation. Human Rights Watch has called Israel’s actions a potential step toward extermination and urged international intervention. Meanwhile, Hamas still holds 58 Israeli hostages. As President Donald Trump visits the Middle East, hopes for a ceasefire or renewed aid remain unmet. Israel denies allegations of genocide amid increasing international concern.",
